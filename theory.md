Autarkies for SAT are partial assignments for boolean CNF, which either satisfy a clause or leave it untouched.

### A- and E-systems
Consider a DQCNF F and k â‰¥ 0:
  1. An Ak -autarky for F is an autarky such that all boolean functions assigned depend essentially on at most k variables. 
  2. An Ek -autarky is an autarky assigns at most k (existential) variables.

  - A0 and A1 allow the boolean functions to essentially depend on 0 resp. 1 universal variable.

  - E1 only uses one existential variable.

We have considered three Autarky Systems A1, E1, A1 + E1.
